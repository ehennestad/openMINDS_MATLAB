MATLAB package for the openMINDS metadata framework for linked data in neuroscience. The package contains all the latest openMINDS schemas as MATLAB classes in addition to schema base classes and utility methods.

To generally learn more about the openMINDS metadata framework please go to :arrow_right: [**ReadTheDocs**](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io).  
You can test and learn how to use openMINDS in MATLAB by going through a small :arrow_right: [**DEMO**](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=openMetadataInitiative/openMINDS_MATLAB&file=code/gettingStarted.mlx) on MATLAB Online.  

MathWorks provides a free basic version of [MATLAB Online](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html), but you need to register a [MathWorks Account](https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mathworks.com%2Fproducts%2Fmatlab.html).


## Installation

openMINDS for MATLAB can be installed from MATLAB's addon manager (recommended). It is also possible to download the MATLAB toolbox from FileExchange or from the Releases page of this repository and install it manually.

MATLAB package for the openMINDS metadata framework for linked data in neuroscience. The package contains all the latest openMINDS schemas as MATLAB classes in addition to schema base classes and utility methods.

To generally learn more about the openMINDS metadata framework please go to :arrow_right: [**ReadTheDocs**](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io).  
You test and learn how to use openMINDS in MATLAB going through a small :arrow_right: [**DEMO**](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=openMetadataInitiative/openMINDS_MATLAB&file=code/gettingStarted.mlx) on MATLAB Online.
